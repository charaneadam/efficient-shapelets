# Effective and Efficient Shapelet Selection for the Classification of Timeseries

Code for the paper *Effective and Efficient Shapelet Selection for the
Classification of Timeseries*.


## Summary
Extraction and evaluation are two crucial steps in the time series
classification with shapelets. We first argue that the bottleneck of the
computation is due to the huge number of candidate shapelets, then we address
the problem by proposing an approach that reduces the candidates significantly
while maintaining high quality candidates which result in high classification
accuracy. Then, we propose an evaluation function based on the silhouette
score which is intuitive and more accurate, especially when the number of
candidates used to classify the datasets is small.
